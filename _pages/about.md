Hi there! I’m Ann, a third-year PhD student in Neuroscience at Harvard University and the Kempner Institute, supported by the Kempner Graduate Fellowship.

Neural computation is better understood as an equivalence class of dynamical mechanisms shaped by inputs and interactions. My work develops methods, frameworks, and theory to identify and interpret the computations implemented by biological and artificial systems through the lens of dynamical systems theory and machine learning, and to relate these computations to learning, control, and multi-area interactions.

<!-- I graduated from McGill University in May 2023 with a major in Neuroscience and a double minor in Mathematics and Computer Science. As an undergraduate, I had the amazing oppotunity of working with Blake Richards and Mark Brandon at McGill, Alexander Mathis at EPFL, and Sam Gershman at Harvard. These awesome mentors have deeply influenced my path into research. -->

Outside research, I enjoy skiing, hiking, climbing, reading, travelling, listening to rock musics and attending concerts.

I'm always happy to chat about research and life, brainstorm, and collaborate. Reach me at [annhuang@g.harvard.edu](mailto:annhuang@g.harvard.edu). If you are an undergrad seeking advice on grad school applications, navigating research opportunities, or figuring out whether a PhD is right for you, feel free to drop me an email too.
